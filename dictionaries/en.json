    "title": "Transforming my passion into a force for positive change in the world.",
    "text": "I am a computer science student who had the pleasure of being a professional gamer in the past, representing various organizations in numerous competitions nationwide. I switched professions when I realized that programming is an incredible power â€“ there are virtually no limits here.\n\nI have a passion for creating, especially when it can make a positive difference in people's lives. I would describe myself as an explorer-perfectionist; in every situation, I strive to extract everything to the last grain. I see work as an opportunity for growth, which I consider essential in life.\n\nCurrently, I am expanding applications based on Next.js and Tailwind CSS. In the near future, I plan to broaden my horizons by delving into Figma design, working with WebSockets, and learning the Svelte framework."
